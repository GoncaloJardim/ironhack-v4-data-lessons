    "> Agents are systems that use LLMs as **reasoning engines** to determine which actions to take and the inputs necessary to perform the action. After executing actions, the results can be fed back into the LLM to determine whether more actions are needed, or whether it is okay to finish. This is often achieved via tool-calling. *(Source: [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/agents/))*\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id='toc1_1_2_'></a>[How Do LLM Agents Work?](#toc0_)\n",
    "Just like any other LLM. The only difference is that based on the constraints we put on LLM agents (e.g. prompt, structured output), we are able to get them to fulfill a specific role without further model finetuning. An LLM agent typically sits within a pipeline of LLM agents, like we see in [this example](https://langchain-mrkl.streamlit.app/?ref=streamlit-io-gallery-llms). \n",

    "DAGs are widely used in streamlining data/ML operations that need to happen sequentially and at regular time intervals. Airflow is one of the most basic platforms where you can build this type of pipelines and monitor the success/failure of your pipelines. You can also schedule runs of pipelines, connect to cloud services, etc. Other schedulers used by data scientists are Prefect (recommended), Dask (for large-scale data processing), Kubeflow pipelines (can be overkill), DAGster. \n",
