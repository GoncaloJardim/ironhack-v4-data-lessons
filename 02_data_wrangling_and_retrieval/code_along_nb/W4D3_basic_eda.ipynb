    "\n",
    "1. In some cases, a **numerical or quantitative variable may represent a categorical or qualitative variable**. For example, if a dataset includes a column with numerical values representing different categories or labels, such as \"0\" for \"male\" and \"1\" for \"female,\" it should be treated as a categorical variable rather than a true numerical variable. Always consider the context and meaning of the data when determining the appropriate data type. *That's why in the first image there is a balloon where it says \"Categorical - made of words\"- coming out of it saying \"Or numbers (if they represent categories)\".*\n",
